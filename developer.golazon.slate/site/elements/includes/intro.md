# About

**Golazon** is a [one-guy](http://www.sobstel.org/)-driven initiative to present basic football
data in simple, clear and unbloated way.

At this moment it's more a fun and hobby project than anything else.
As yet it's just all non-profit after-hours work.

Projects underway:

* **schema** - flexible scalable denormalized non-relational football (soccer) data model on top
  of document-oriented database concepts.
* **data store**
* **albicelestes** - players-oriented website covering current and past argentinian players

Projects planned (though not certain to be ever done)

* **golazon.com** - scores and tables
    * **www** - website
    * **app** - iOS and Android apps
    * **api** - json&html api
* **data as an api** - direct access to database (for advanced and rich queries)

Golazon name is an agglomeration of *golazo* (slang used to describe an amazing goal)
and *-&oacute;n* (suffix that emphasizes that something is large, grand, intense, important).
It's not really easy to find short *.com* domain that makes any sense these days.
