A bunch unfinished/abandoned football-related projects:

* developer.golazon.nanoc - developer portal API/schema doc (nanoc, not finished)
* developer.golazon.slate - developer portal API/schema doc ([TripIT's Slate](https://github.com/tripit/slate), not finished, but pretty useful tasks for building on top of Slate)
* golazon.rails - basic rails football app (rails & mongodb, not finished)
* schema.nanoc - minimalist football schema (not finished)
* tollerbot - web scraper (just a design, not started)
